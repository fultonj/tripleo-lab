# My Branch of Custom Lab for TripleO
A simple way to bootstrap a bunch of VMs on a libvirt host. Gives more control
than quickstart in some cases.

## Specs
It is expected to run the following resources:
- 1 undercloud
- 3 controllers
- 2 computes
- 3 ceph-storage

The amount of used memory for that env is about 52G, and about 20 CPU cores.

## Prerequisite
### Working ssh-agent on ansible-host
A working ssh-agent must be runnin on the host launching ansible playbook. It
is needed in order to hot-load the private ssh key for the undercloud access.

In case you're running the playbook for a "middle machine", you can just forward
the agent from your workstation.

## Usage
### Standard deploy:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml
```

It will deploy a containerized undercloud and prepare the baremetal.json file
you will use in order to register nodes in ironic.

### Redeploy the lab
If you issue a ```lab-destroy``` on the builder, you will need to redeploy the
lab:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml --tags lab
```

### I have my undercloud and want to replay only specific tasks on it
Just limit with the tags, and be sure to have the ```inventory``` tag. For
example, in order to just manage the overcloud images:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml -t inventory -t overcloud-images
```

### I want to add a new instance to my current lab
Just add the requested information in the yaml you used for the initial deploy,
then:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml -t domains -t baremetal -t vbmc
```

Domain tag will create the instance disk image and add it to libvirt. The vbmc
tag will add the new to vbmc, and enable it. The baremetal tag will take care of
the different configuration on the undercloud.

One note though: you might want to delete the already-existing node(s) from the
baremetal.json on the undercloud, in order to avoid useless error output from
the import task.

Also, this ansible will NOT run the import task once more, it doesn't ensure
all nodes are present. You will need to run, on your own:
```Bash
source ~/stackrc
openstack overcloud node import --provide baremetal.json
```

### Extend the lab
You can pass variables and environment files using the ```-e``` option, like:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml --skip-tags overcloud-images --tags lab -e @environments/3ctl-1compute.yaml
```
This will start a lab with just 3 controllers and 1 compute.

### Validations
You can run tempest validations against standalone and undercloud deploy. In order to run
just the validations and avoid having to wait to much time, you can run the following command:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml -t inventory -t validations
```

### Metrics
The project now allows to gather metrics about the undercloud instance. In order
to activate requested things on the builder (namely, run a couple of containers),
you need to add the following tag the first time you re-deploy the lab:
```Bash
ansible-playbook builder.yaml --tags metrics,lab
```

Please note this will install podman on the builder, and start two containers,
one for graphite, the other for grafana.

Graphite has two persistent data directories located in ```/var/lib/containers/storage/mounts/graphite```.

In case you want to clean up data, you can go in ```/var/lib/containers/storage/mounts/graphite/storage/whisper```
and remove the data related to your undercloud.

The cleanup is NOT done when you drop the lab and rebuild it, in order to keep
tracks of older deploy for comparaison purpose.
